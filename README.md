-- When pitching, there are 4 different areas: Release, Timing, & Delivery.

++Release

Spin Direction
The direction of the ball’s spin after release as it travels to the plate.  Spin direction is defined as the direction of motion of the leading edge of the ball (the side of the ball facing the batter as it moves to the plate).  

Ball spin is what causes the ball to break due to aerodynamic forces acting on it during flight.  The direction of break is the same as the spin direction. The amount of break is dependent on the spin rate, so knowing both of these values tells you about both the direction and amount of break that you can expect from your pitches.

Release Velocity
The speed of the ball just after it is released from the hand. Speed is measured in MPH (miles per hour).

Spin Rate
The average spin rate of the ball as it travels from the point of release until it is caught. Spin rate is measured in RPMs (revolutions per minute).

The higher spin rate generally means more break on the pitch; that is, more movement side-to-side or up-and-down.

Spin Direction
The direction of the ball’s spin after release as it travels to the plate. Spin Direction is defined as the direction of motion of the leading edge of the ball (the side of the ball facing the batter as it moves to the plate).

Ball spin is what causes the ball to break due to aerodynamic forces acting on it during flight. The direction of break is the same as the spin direction. The amount of break is dependent on the spin rate, so knowing both of these values tells you about both the direction and amount of break that you can expect from your pitches.

++Timing
Time to Plate
The time from initial movement of the pitcher’s hands from the set position until impact of the ball with the catcher’s mitt (or impact with a net if throwing into a net).

This time is important because the less time it takes for a pitcher to get the ball to the catcher, the less time a runner has to steal a base. Time to Plate is made up of delivery time and ball flight time (the time it takes the ball to get from pitcher’s hand at release to the catcher). A pitcher can focus on controlling his delivery time to reduce the total time to plate.

Delivery
Delivery time is the total time the ball is in the player’s hand from initial movement to the release of the ball. It can be broken down into segments, namely set to reach back time and reach back to release time.

Reducing delivery time helps to reduce time to plate and makes it harder for runners to steal bases. In addition, it is important for a pitcher to keep his delivery the same across different pitch types. This makes it harder for batters to pick up on different pitches being thrown.

For position players, reducing time to deliver the ball to the base reduces the distance a baserunner travels while the fielder has the ball in his hands.

Reach Back to Release Time
The time from the cocking point in the delivery until release of the ball.

This is the second phase of the pitch and can tip a pitch if there is different time for different pitch types. It also contributes to total Time to Plate when trying to hold runners on base.

++Delivery
Extension
The horizontal distance, directed toward the catcher, from set point to release of the ball from the hand. This is a measure of how far the pitcher reaches toward home when throwing the ball.

Extension is important for pitches because it essentially shortens the distance and puts them closer to the plate. The average extension of a MLB pitcher is 6.5 feet. An extension longer than 6.5 feet will make the pitch appear faster to the batter, giving the batter less time to recognize the pitch. An extension shorter than 6.5 feet will make the pitch appear slower to the batter, giving them more time to recognize the pitch.

Pitches:
- The Four-Seam Fastball. These pitches are the fastest in baseball, averaging around 95 mph (153 km/h). Spread your fingers slightly with the tips barely over the laces of the ball.
- The Two-Seam Fastball. This pitch will be slightly slower and less accurate than the four-seam, but it also curves as it reaches the batter, making it harder to hit. To hold, grip the ball along the seams with your index and middle finger.
- The Changeup. This pitch moves in the air quite a bit. Put your thumb and index finger in a circle, and then use your other three fingers to center the baseball.
- The Curveball. Keep your index finger and middle right and tight next to each other on the seams. throw like you normally do but snap your wrist when throwing the curve.
- The Slider. A slider seems like a fastball until the last second, when it curves to one side. Grip with your index and middle fingers across the seam at its widest point.
- The Forkball. This ball is almost impossible to hit when thrown well. Jam the ball between your index and middle finger.
- The Knuckleball. This ball will wiggle as it moves towards the batter. Dig your fingernails into the middle of the ball seams.
- The Split Finger. This pitch will appear to be a fastball, but will drop as it nears the batter, making it difficult to hit. You need large hands to throw this pitch effectively. Hold the ball as if you would for the two-seam fastball. Rotate the ball toward yourself, so your fingers are along the horseshoe seam. Spread your fingers to the outside of the seams and place your thumb directly under the ball.


-- When swinging, there are 4 different areas: Power, Speed, Quickness, Control, swing path measurements, hip rotation, attack angle. 

++In the “Power” section there are 3 different metrics:
- Applied Power – Measures the power of your swing in watts
- Max Acceleration – How fast the bat gets to top speed
- Impact Momentum – This is a very helpful stat. It’s the amount of momentum in the bat when it makes contact with the baseball. This is determined by barrel speed at impact & the weight of the bat. Many players are using the wrong size bat and don’t even know it! This stat can help determine what a player’s ideal bat size really is.

++In the “Speed” section there are 4 different metrics:
- Max Hand Speed – How fast your hands move through the zone
- Max Barrel Speed – Maximum bat speed during your swing
- Speed Efficiency – Percentage of contact made with the baseball when the barrel is at max speed (This is helpful because it reveals common problems like making contact too deep, too early, or only gaining max speed after contact. Obviously, you want to be at max bat speed when you make contact. Too many of us aren’t doing that and we may not even realize it. This stat reveals if a player is getting the most out of his bat speed.)
Forward Barrel Speed – The bat speed at the point of the swing when the barrel of the bat is at a 90 degree angle to the pitcher (This is the strongest body position at contact. This is our best point of contact because it’s when you’re perfectly square to the baseball with no rounding momentum. The closer your forward bat speed is to your max barrel speed, the better your contact will be, the better mental approach you have at the plate, and the more fundamentally sound your swing is.)

A number of random factors occurring during a swing, including not knowing whether contact is being made at the optimal point of the swing path, or a complete miss are possibilities. 
Bat Vertical – Angle of the bat at contact could vary also, depending on the location of the pitch.

++In the “Quickness” section there is one metric:
- Trigger to Impact Time – The time from start of forward bat motion to contact. You can compare your numbers to everyone in your skill level. If your score is below average, it can indicate several inefficiencies in a swing, such as barring the front arm, improper use of legs, too heavy of a bat, and too much upper body tension.

Improving Trigger To Impact time will:
1) Help the batter wait longer to identify the pitch
2) Help the batter determine the location of the pitch
3) Help the batter catch up to, and make contact with faster pitches or make adjustments mid-swing

++In the ”Control” section there are 3 different metrics:
- Distance in the Zone – How long your barrel is in the hitting zone. This is another BIG one. For obvious reasons. The best hitters in the world excel in this area.
- Hand Cast Distance – How far your hands get away from your body. The closer your hands stay to your body, the better you’ll be at staying inside the baseball. When your hands are closer to your body, it’s easier to drive balls the other way and pull balls correctly. This also creates “the ice-skater effect.” Once an ice skater starts spinning in circles, they spin faster when their hands closer to their body. The same thing happens in a baseball swing. Hands closer to the body can result in better bat speed. The further your hands are from your body, the more you get “around” baseballs. This tends to cause a lot pull-side ground balls and top-spin line drives – none of which are good.
- Approach Angle at Impact – There’s 3 types of bat paths… uppercut, chop swing and level swing. A positive number shows an uppercut and a negative number shows chopping down on the baseball. A score of zero indicates a perfectly level swing. Since the average pitch comes into the hitting zone between 6 and 14 degrees, an approach angle between 6 and 14 degrees is an ideal bat path.

The optimum launch angle of a home run is between +20° and +35° degrees. In order to achieve this goal, the batter must swing below the path of the incoming pitch, with the bat moving upwards in order to get a positive approach angle. This will ultimately lead to the desired results of the optimum launch angle for a home run.

The optimum approach angle typically needs to be between +5° degrees and +15° degrees in order to hit a hard line drive and between +20° degrees and +35° degrees in order to hit a home run. A negative Approach Angle is the result of a ‘chop’ type swing and usually leads to ground balls.


--Now that we have covered the basic aspects of a swing while taking place, it's time for the fundamentals behind it:

++Stance

The beginnings of perfect mechanics are the components of the stance.  The following descriptions are the ideals for a batting stance and should be the goal of every batter:
•    Weight over the balls of the feet; never over the heels
•    Knees bent
•    Shoulders level
•    Hands a comfortable distance away from the back shoulder; often this is 10-12 inches from the shoulder, though it is up to the batter’s preference

++Hip Placement and Movement
As the batter begins the swing, the hips come into play for the first time.  The lower body, especially the hips, is extremely important in hitting.  Though they may not seem connected, the hips play a major role in the power and distance of a hit, because they create the necessary torque to drive the ball. 
When the batter starts the swing, the hips should turn in a bit, toward the catcher.  The hands pull back toward the back shoulder and start the pre-launch torque that drives the body through the rest of the swing.

As the arms rotate through the swing, the hips should also rotate.  Since they have inverted toward the catcher during the pre-swing, they will now more easily lead the body through the swing itself.

By starting the movement at the hips and letting it drive up the body through the arms, batters ensure that they put the most possible power behind the bat.  If the hips follow the arms or do not turn at all, the batter will have a much more difficult time producing the kind of hit they desire.

++Pre-Swing
There are several important movements that happen during the pre-swing.  We have already discussed the inverted movement of the hips.  At this point, the following things also need to happen:
•    Front shoulder and chin tuck in
•    Hands pull back
•    Eyes should be toward the pitcher, with the head turned instead of keeping it straight down
•    Hold the bat at a 45 degree angle to avoid any unnecessary movement

While in the stance, players should stand slightly farther apart than shoulder width.  This allows players to keep their weight centered and lower into the ground, giving the player a wider base from which to pull power from the lower body.

++Grip
Having a proper grip is essential for maintaining a smooth, consistent swing.  Batters should line up their middle knuckles on the bat so that their hands are in the steadiest position possible.  If the knuckles are not in this stabilizing position, the bat has a tendency to jump in the hands as batters turn their wrists over as they finish the swing.

++Stride
Each player has a preference about how big or small of a stride to take on the swing.  Batters should do what is most comfortable for them, provided that they do not step on the line of the batter’s box, as this will cause them to be called out.

When helping players determine how big of a stride to take, encourage them to experiment.  A shorter stride is usually better than a longer one for control purposes, because it keeps the player over their body and does not allow things to get out of rhythm.  As speed is a necessary part of batting, a short stride is desirable because it helps batters move to their next element, the swing, sooner.

As the batter is about to bring their hands forward to start the swinging motion, the striding leg should come forward toward the pitcher.  The stride should be toward the area in front of home plate to help the batter get into better position.
Swing

During the swing, there are also small adjustments that players can make to ensure that they get the best swing possible.  When working on mechanics, even the smallest details count.

Throughout the swing, players should keep their back elbow up and close to the body.  This allows the hands and the barrel of the bat to swing through completely.  Finally, and perhaps most importantly when going through the swing, is to keep the head still.  Keeping the head still ensures that you keep proper balance throughout the swing, which is otherwise hard to do because the batter is moving nearly every other part to connect with the ball.

Maintaining a still head also helps with creating a rhythm.  If the batter’s body has one still part that does not move or change during the swing, that batter will have a better idea of what part of their swing needs work or what part is not synchronized with the rest of the body.  Whether in practice or in play, keeping a steady head is extremely important.

As the ball is pitched, batters should bring their hands to meet the ball.  This mental picture will help players get the bat in contact with the ball in exactly the right place.  At the same time that batters are bringing their hands to the ball, they should be keeping those hands level and still, so that the bat slices through the air on an even plane.  A swing with any type of loop or wiggle can cause a dangerous pop-up, which can be detrimental to the team.

++Run Drills
Just because a batter has been batting for years does not mean that they will maintain good form.  In fact, more experience can lead to poor form because players become complacent and pay less attention to their form than when they were first learning it.

Every so often, at the discretion of the coach, players should go back and work on basic drills for hitting mechanics.  This means starting from a tee, using a whiffle ball.  While some players may grumble about starting at such a fundamental level, you must show them the importance of being able to hit a whiffle ball off a tee, perfectly, every time.  If players cannot hit a ball where they want it to go when it is sitting right in front of them, how are they going to be able to hit a ball moving toward them at 50 miles an hour or more?

When players hit a whiffle ball correctly from a tee, it acts like a knuckleball.  When players hit is incorrectly, it spins uncontrollably and goes awry.  Because of the air going through the ball, players will be able to see their mistakes easier and make adjustments as necessary.

After players become comfortable again with hitting from a tee, remove the tee and have them practice with regular pitches again.  They will notice a difference in the way they hold themselves and approach the ball, and you will a difference in their effectiveness.
